# An accurate classifier for IMDB reviews
## Description
We ([egrinstein](https://github.com/egrinstein),[biavaz](https://github.com/biavaz),[psava](https://github.com/patricksava)) made an SVM classifier with 85%
accuracy. We trained it with 25.000 reviews and validated it with another 25.000.
 
## Try it
Write in terminal:

`$python classify_reviews_svm.py`

It should work on windows and unix.
Once the application finishes creating it's model, training and validating it, it 
will read a review stored in _review.txt_ and classify it. If you'd like, you can 
paste a review of your favorite (or least favorite) movie and see how it will do.
