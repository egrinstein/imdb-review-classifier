Minions is a family night out. Pack your bags everyone and go to your nearest theater and see Minions. You will not find a better family film then this. I love the minions so I would by far be there to see them, and I was. I laughed so hard, and I saw it already 6 times. It was really good in 3D. Your kids will love the comedy in this movie.

Minions is the best family film I have seen in 15 years. They are so cute and funny. It has a great cast in it that you will never forget. There is no other movie like this even though it is a spin off it is so different then the other movies like it. So get some popcorn get a soda get your 3d glasses and enjoy Minions.
